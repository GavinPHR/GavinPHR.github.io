Computer science undergraduate in <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics" target="_blank">School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh</a>. Currently averaging **84%** and expected to graduate in 2021. 

People usually call me **Gavin**.

### Current Highlight (updated 07/Jan/2020):
I am trying to apply the theories I have learnt from Iain Murray's course **Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition** in real-world problems. To learn more practical machine learning, I am reading **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow** by Aurélien Géron (fantastic book, would recommend). Get in touch if you are interested in Kaggling with me.

### Work Experience

* **Teaching Assistant**, <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics" target="_blank">the University of Edinburgh</a>  
`May 2019 - Jan 2020`  
During term time, I produced weekly tutorial sheets. I also carried out administrative tasks such as managing content online, answering questions on our course forum, attending different tutorials to ensure consistency.  
During summer vacation (May - September), I worked full-time under the supervision of Professor Michael Fourman. I produced a comprehensive book covering the topics tought in the undergraduate informatics course Introduction to Computation. This course was recently changed and now includes substantial amount of functional programming in Haskell. Professor Fourman and I made considerable amount of effort to make course materials as seemless as possible. 

* **Tutor**, **Exam Inivigilator**, **Exam Maker**, <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics" target="_blank">the University of Edinburgh</a>  
`Sep 2018 - Jan 2019`  
I was appointed to the teaching support role for the first-year informatics course Introduction to Computation. The course was comprised of two main topics – logic in computer science and functional programming with Haskell. My main duty was to deliver tutorials and respond to students' questions on Piazza. At the end of the course, I invigilated the programming exam and marked the written exam.  
I took this course in the 17/18 academic year under Professor Michael Fourman and Professor Don Sannella. I achieved excellent results and have since been highly involved with the course.
