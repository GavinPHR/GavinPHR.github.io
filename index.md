# Computer science undergraduate in [School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics). Currently averaging >80%. 

## Work Experience

* Teaching Support `May 2019 - Present` 

Currently, I am working full-time to improve the course Introduction to Computation under the supervision of Professor Michael Fourman.

* Tutor, Exam Inivigilator, Exam Maker `Sep 2018 - Jan 2019`

I was appointed to the teaching support role for the first-year informatics course Introduction to Computation. The course was comprised of two main topics â€“ logic in computer science and functional programming with Haskell. My main duty was to deliver tutorials and respond to students' questions on Piazza. At the end of the course, I invigilated the programming exam and marked the written exam. 

I took this course in the 17/18 academic year under Professor Michael Fourman and Professor Don Sannella. I achieved excellent results and have since been highly involved with the course.
