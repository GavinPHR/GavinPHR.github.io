Computer science undergraduate in <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics" target="_blank">School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh</a>. Currently averaging 84% and expected to graduate in 2021.  

### Current Highlight:
Working full-time to improve the newly combined course <a href="http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/19-20/dpt/cxinfr08025.htm" target="_blank">Informatics 1 - Introduction to Computation</a> in which we introduce propositional logic, finite state machines, and functional programming. 

I am producing materials including <a href="notes.pdf">course notes</a> and <a href="sheet.pdf">tutorial sheets</a>. They are aimed at students without any prior knowledge in the field of computer science.   

I am also investigating different technological solutions (Jupyter Notebook, repl.it, and HaSchool) that assist in programming teaching.  

If you think you have something to contribute to this course, don't hesitate to contact me.

### Work Experience

* Teaching Support, <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics" target="_blank">School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh</a>  
`May 2019 - Present`  
Currently, I am working full-time to improve the course Introduction to Computation under the supervision of Professor Michael Fourman.  

* Tutor, Exam Inivigilator, Exam Maker, <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics" target="_blank">School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh</a>  
`Sep 2018 - Jan 2019`  
I was appointed to the teaching support role for the first-year informatics course Introduction to Computation. The course was comprised of two main topics â€“ logic in computer science and functional programming with Haskell. My main duty was to deliver tutorials and respond to students' questions on Piazza. At the end of the course, I invigilated the programming exam and marked the written exam.  
I took this course in the 17/18 academic year under Professor Michael Fourman and Professor Don Sannella. I achieved excellent results and have since been highly involved with the course.
