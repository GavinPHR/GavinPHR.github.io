Final year computer science undergraduate at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics" target="_blank">the University of Edinburgh</a>. Currently averaging **84%**. 

People usually call me **Gavin**.

### Current Highlight (updated 12/Mar/2021):
I have just finalized the <a href="https://github.com/GavinPHR/Spectral-Parser" target="_blank">code for my final year project on Spectral Learning of Latent-Variable PCFGs</a>, supervised by Dr Shay Cohen. The model can be trained in under 10 minutes on a laptop CPU, and it achieves good parsing accuracy on PTB WSJ section 23.

This coming October, I will be joining Oxford to do an <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/msc-computer-science/" target="_blank">MSc in Advanced Computer Science</a>.

### Work Experience

* **Teaching Assistant**, <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics" target="_blank">the University of Edinburgh</a>  
`May 2019 - Jan 2021`  
During term time, I produced weekly tutorial sheets. I also carried out administrative tasks such as managing content online, answering questions on our course forum, attending different tutorials to ensure consistency.  
During summer vacation (May - September), I worked full-time under the supervision of Professor Michael Fourman. I produced a comprehensive set of notes, covering the topics tought in the undergraduate informatics course Introduction to Computation. Professor Don Sannella compiled the notes into a book that additionally covers functional programming, projected to be published summer 2021.

* **Tutor**, **Exam Inivigilator**, **Exam Maker**, <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics" target="_blank">the University of Edinburgh</a>  
`Sep 2018 - Jan 2019`  
I was appointed to the teaching support role for the first-year informatics course Introduction to Computation. The course was comprised of two main topics â€“ logic in computer science and functional programming with Haskell. My main duty was to deliver tutorials and respond to students' questions on Piazza. At the end of the course, I invigilated the programming exam and marked the written exam.  
I took this course in the 17/18 academic year under Professor Michael Fourman and Professor Don Sannella. I achieved excellent results and have since been highly involved with the course.
