I reply to emails fairly quickly (that is, much quicker than average).  
### Work Experience

* Teaching Support, <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics" target="_blank">School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; `May 2019 - Present`  
Currently, I am working full-time to improve the course Introduction to Computation under the supervision of Professor Michael Fourman.

* Tutor, Exam Inivigilator, Exam Maker, <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics" target="_blank">School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; `Sep 2018 - Jan 2019`  
I was appointed to the teaching support role for the first-year informatics course Introduction to Computation. The course was comprised of two main topics â€“ logic in computer science and functional programming with Haskell. My main duty was to deliver tutorials and respond to students' questions on Piazza. At the end of the course, I invigilated the programming exam and marked the written exam.  
I took this course in the 17/18 academic year under Professor Michael Fourman and Professor Don Sannella. I achieved excellent results and have since been highly involved with the course.
